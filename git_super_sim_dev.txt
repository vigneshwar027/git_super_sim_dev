GIT 

to check if git already exist in machine
type git and enter

the git cycles has two stages

1.  changed area (any files that are changed sits here)
2.  staged area (file that are meant to be added to the next version that is those that are meant to be committed sits here.)

once the files are committed the files are cleared from both changed area and staged area

so now to initially move a file from the changed area to staged area we use the command

    git add ~file/folder name or .

in git terms
    version = commit
    so saying commit or commit history means version or version history

    thus git commit means we are creating a version


how can u edit a commit that you messed up:
    do : git add . (again)
         git commit -m "the new commit msg" --amend

    this amends the previous commit rather creating a new one.


git log 
    shows the list of commits thats is done


when u run the git add command u are moving the files from changes area to staging area(those files that are selected for commit)

so when u wanna move the files back from the staging area back to changes area u use the below command
    git reset ~thefilename-uwanna-move-back
    git reset . (moves all files/folder from the staging area back to changes environment )

when we a file is untracked it means it is not yet added to the staging area
