GIT 

to check if git already exist in machine
type git and enter

to demote which files/folder has to be tracked for the next version
we use the command

git add ~file/folder name

this says for the next version

in git terms
    version = commit
    so saying commit or commit history means version or version history

    thus git commit means we are creating a version


how can u edit a commit that you messed up:
    do : git add . (again)
         git commit -m "the new commit msg" --amend

    this amends the previous commit rather creating a new one.


git log 
    shows the list of commits thats is done


when u run the git add command u are moving the files from changes area to staging area(those files that are selected for commit)

so when u wanna move the files back from the staging area back to changes area u use the below command
    git reset ~thefilename-uwanna-move-back
    git reset . (moves all files/folder from the staging area back to changes environment )

when we a file is untracked it means it is not yet added to the staging area
