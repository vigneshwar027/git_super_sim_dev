GIT 

to check if git already exist in machine
type git and enter

the git cycles has two stages

1.  changed area (any files that are changed sits here)
2.  staged area (file that are meant to be added to the next version that is those that are meant to be committed sits here.)

once the files are committed the files are cleared from both changed area and staged area

so now to initially move a file from the changed area to staged area we use the command

    git add ~file/folder name or .

in git terms
    version = commit
    so saying commit or commit history means version or version history
    so please remember the word commit as version

    thus git commit means we are creating a version


how can u edit a commit that you messed up:
    do : git add . (again)
         git commit -m "the new commit msg" --amend

    this amends the previous commit rather creating a new one.


git log 
    shows the list of commits thats is done


when u run the git add command u are moving the files from changes area to staging area(those files that are selected for commit)

so when u wanna move the files back from the staging area back to changes area u use the below command
    git reset ~thefilename-uwanna-move-back
    git reset . (moves all files/folder from the staging area back to changes environment )

when a file says:
    untracked(U) - it is not yet added to staging area since inception
    modified(M) - it is modified from the previous commit/version


switching between the commits 

usually we may wanna switch between one commit to any previous commit
to do so:
    git checkout ~commit-hash

    consider u r switching from version3(ur last commit) to version2

    once after checkout, now when u use git log, it shows you only the past commit histories.
    this is coz by default git log shows only only from the current commit you are in till the past commits

    so to see the other one also use
    git log --all

    note: HEAD denotes nothing but the commit that you are currently in.
