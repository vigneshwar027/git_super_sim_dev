going further to push code online and have a backup


why online?
    there are chances ur machine might mess up

    so to push a code to online

    step1: 1st u need a remote placeholders for that we you wanna create a remote repository or an existing one.

    step2: one a repository is made available, u wanna create a bridge between you local repo and the remote repo

        for this you use
        git remote add <any-nickname> <remote repo's https url>

        usually the nickname is origin by convention

        thus eg: git remote add myorigin1 some_url

    to see if ur local repo is pointing to which remote 
    git remote --verbose or git remote -v(in short)

    to set username
    git config --global credential.user <"username">

    pushing
    while we push a code along with the commit history 
    we push one branch at a time 

    so the command is 
    git push <origin-name> <remote branch name>
    eg: git push origin branch12

    note : the branch u mention here denotes always the remote branch where u wanna push
    and which branch is being pushed is always by default ur current branch.

    pushing issues:
    when pushing is not getting done
    
    1. check if the remote url is http and not shows
    2. try changing the url by adding ur username before after the http
        eg: https://vigneshwar027@github/....the rest
    3. try deleting the keychain access and now git will ask for username
    and password - the password is not the log in password but the generated token

        to generate token 
            setting->developer setting->generate token
    
    4. if not finally go for ssh keys


viewing files in github
    in github u can go see each commits and browse files option there helps u go back in time see how all ur files were in a specific commit.


git push:
    git push origin master --set-upstream
    the above sets the this origin as a default origin for any upcoming push
    so u can simply do git push the next time

    also a git push command will only push the commits, so if u have not added ur changes to staging area using git add. and commiting with git commit. no push will happen. it simply says everything upto date.

    consider a scenario
        where u have made a commit locally and pushed it to origin too
        then u are amending the same commit locally using
        git commit -m "dsfds" --amend

        now this amends the latest commit locally but not remotely
        after amending if u push to the remote it wont accept coz there is already a commit in its place.

        so youll have to force push (overwrite the remote commit) using
        git push origin master <--force|-f>


copying repo from remote to local

    git clone <the repo url> <the folder name>
    if a folder name is not provided a folder is created in the name of the repo u clone

usually when any changes happened in ur remote by someone's else push or direct edit in the website.

it is obvious that ur remote and local wont be in same commit
and to always check if ur local and remote are in same commit
we use git log --all --graph
but the changes that happened in remote wont reflect in ur terminal automatically.
so it is necessary to run 
git fetch(to fetch the latest remote commit status)
then run git log --all --graph

these are the lines added from the website



git pull and clone:
    git pull pulls all the changes that has happened on the remote branch of the repo
    git clone clones the whole repo and it's commit histories

    pull is branch specific
    clone is repo specific

    thats y u specific
    git pull <origin> <branch name>
    git clone <repo url>


    when u run git clone 
    git makes a copy inside the folder that the terminal is currently opened in
