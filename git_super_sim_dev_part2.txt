going further to push code online and have a backup


why online?
    there are chances ur machine might mess up

    so to push a code to online

    step1: 1st u need a remote placeholders for that we you wanna create a remote repository or an existing one.

    step2: one a repository is made available, u wanna create a bridge between you local repo and the remote repo

        for this you use
        git remote add <any-nickname> <remote repo's https url>

        usually the nickname is origin by convention

        thus eg: git remote add myorigin1 some_url

    to see if ur local repo is pointing to which remote 
    git remote --verbose or git remote -v(in short)

    to set username
    git config --global credentials.user <"username">

    pushing
    while we push a code along with the commit history 
    we push one branch at a time
