going further to push code online and have a backup


why online?
    there are chances ur machine might mess up

    so to push a code to online

    step1: 1st u need a remote placeholders for that we you wanna create a remote repository or an existing one.

    step2: one a repository is made available, u wanna create a bridge between you local repo and the remote repo

        for this you use
        git remote add <any-nickname> <remote repo's https url>

        usually the nickname is origin by convention

        thus eg: git remote add myorigin1 some_url

    to see if ur local repo is pointing to which remote 
    git remote --verbose or git remote -v(in short)

    to set username
    git config --global credential.user <"username">

    pushing
    while we push a code along with the commit history 
    we push one branch at a time 

    so the command is 
    git push <origin-name> <remote branch name>
    eg: git push origin branch12

    note : the branch u mention here denotes always the remote branch where u wanna push
    and which branch is being pushed is always by default ur current branch.

    pushing issues:
    when pushing is not getting done
    
    1. check if the remote url is http and not shows
    2. try changing the url by adding ur username before after the http
        eg: https://vigneshwar027@github/....the rest
    3. try deleting the keychain access and now git will ask for username
    and password - the password is not the log in password but the generated token

        to generate token 
            setting->developer setting->generate token
    
    4. if not finally go for ssh keys
