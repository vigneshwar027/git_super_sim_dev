git branching and merging

so when arises a scenario for branching

    consider u have a code with a main branch that already has mulitple commit histories in it

    now there is a need for new feature to be implemented step by step but that should not disturb the existing main branch.

    this is where we need a new branch to work on

    everytime a new branch is created, it is like creating a copy of the main branch.
    and then starting to work from there.

to create new branch
    git branch <branch name>

to view list of available local branches
    git branch
